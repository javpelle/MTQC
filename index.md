## Welcome to MTQC Docs

### Quickstart

Download [zip file](https://github.com/javpelle/MTQC/releases/download/v0.1/MTQC-v0.1.zip) on your computer and extract it. 
On MTQC folder run **MTQC-v0.1.jar** file.

MTQC needs Python for run quantum mutation testing. We recommend you to install Python with [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/). If you don't have Python installed, you can't do quantum testing but you can generate mutants.

MTQC supports [**Qiskit**](https://qiskit.org/) and [**Q#**](https://qsharp.community/) quantum languages. To test on Qiskit you must [install](https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html) it:
```bash
pip install qiskit
```

To test on Q# check this [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/quickstarts/).
